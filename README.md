# üìö Core-Subjects

Welcome to the **Core-Subjects** repository! This repo is a comprehensive collection of my practice files covering essential topics in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Operating Systems (OS). Each topic is packed with multiple problems and their solutions, all organized into separate files for easy navigation. Dive in and explore the core subjects of computer science with me! üöÄ

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### üß© Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
1. **Arrays and Strings**: Learn how to manipulate arrays and strings efficiently. From basic operations to advanced algorithms, find everything you need to master these fundamental structures.
2. **Linked Lists**: Discover the power of linked lists. Practice creating, manipulating, and traversing single, double, and circular linked lists.
3. **Stacks and Queues**: Understand the principles of stacks and queues. Solve problems involving these linear data structures and learn their applications.
4. **Trees and Graphs**: Explore the hierarchical world of trees and graphs. Implement binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and graph traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS.
5. **Hashing**: Grasp the concept of hashing and hash tables. Practice solving problems related to collisions, hash functions, and efficient data retrieval.
6. **Sorting and Searching**: Master sorting algorithms (like QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort) and searching techniques (like Binary Search and Depth-First Search).
7. **Dynamic Programming**: Delve into dynamic programming to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Practice classic DP problems like the Knapsack problem and Fibonacci sequence.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
1. **Classes and Objects**: Get a solid foundation in OOP by understanding classes, objects, and their relationships. Practice creating and using classes to build real-world applications.
2. **Inheritance**: Learn about inheritance and how it promotes code reuse. Practice implementing single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance.
3. **Polymorphism**: Dive into polymorphism and understand method overloading and overriding. Solve problems to see how polymorphism can make your code more flexible and maintainable.
4. **Encapsulation**: Discover the importance of encapsulation in hiding the internal state of objects. Practice creating classes that protect their data.
5. **Abstraction**: Understand abstraction and how it simplifies complex systems. Practice designing abstract classes and interfaces to model real-world entities.

### üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems (OS)
1. **Processes and Threads**: Learn about process management, including creation, scheduling, and synchronization of processes and threads. Solve problems to understand the intricacies of concurrency.
2. **Memory Management**: Explore how operating systems handle memory allocation, paging, and segmentation. Practice solving problems related to memory leaks and fragmentation.
3. **File Systems**: Understand the organization of data in file systems. Practice problems related to file creation, deletion, and access permissions.
4. **Synchronization**: Grasp the concepts of synchronization and inter-process communication. Solve problems using semaphores, locks, and monitors.
5. **Deadlocks**: Learn about deadlocks and how to prevent them. Practice identifying and resolving deadlocks in various scenarios.

## üåü Why This Repo?
